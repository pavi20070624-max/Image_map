    <h1>üçΩÔ∏è SKY THRU ROOFTOP RESTAURANT üçΩÔ∏è </h1>
    <img src="{% static 'rooftop restaurant.png' %}"></center>
    <p>
     LOCATION: Plot Number 12, Mount Poonamallee Road, Kattupakkam (also sometimes listed as Mount Poonamalle Road) in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
    </p>
    <P>
     TYPE & STYLE: It's a rooftop restaurant offering an open-air/rooftop seating experience. The ambience is described as casual, cosy, with romantic touches. Sometimes has live music.
    </P>
    <p>
        CUISINE: North Indian is one of the primary cuisines. The menu also leans toward variety including dishes like biryani, some seafood etc.
    </p>
     <p>
    Hours: Generally open for lunch and dinner. According to listings, hours are something like 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM for lunch, then 6:30 PM to 11:00 PM for dinner.
     </p>
    <p>
     SPECIALITY: Chicken Lollipop comes up several times in reviews as one of the standout starters. The crispy, flavourful chicken lollipop appears to be a crowd-pleaser. The biryani (especially prawn biryani) gets praise, also other non-vegetarian dishes are regarded well. People often say non-veg items are better than some of the veg offerings. Since rooftop restaurants often emphasise barbecue or tandoor cooking (smoking, grilling, richer flavours), items like kebabs, tandoori stuff likely feature among what they do well. Some reviews mention interesting welcome drinks or creative non-alcoholic beverages that people appreciated, especially those which balance sweetness, freshness (fruits), etc.  
    </p>
    <p> 
     OVERALL FEEDBACK: Sky Thru Rooftop Restaurant in Chennai enjoys a strong reputation with ratings around 3.8 out of 5, and much of that positivity comes from the unique dining experience it offers. Guests consistently praise the beautiful rooftop ambience, with its open-air seating, cozy lighting, and relaxed atmosphere that makes it a perfect choice for date nights, family dinners, or special occasions. The service staff are often highlighted for their polite and attentive approach, making diners feel welcomed and comfortable. On the food front, several dishes have become customer favourites ‚Äî especially the chicken lollipop, prawn biryani, and grilled starters, which many say are flavourful and satisfying. While prices lean toward the higher side, most visitors feel the overall combination of good food, courteous service, and a refreshing rooftop view more than makes up for it. In short, the restaurant‚Äôs positive ratings reflect its ability to deliver not just a meal, but a pleasant and memorable dining experience.
