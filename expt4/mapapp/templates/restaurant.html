     SPECIALITY: Chicken Lollipop comes up several times in reviews as one of the standout starters. The crispy, flavourful chicken lollipop appears to be a crowd-pleaser. The biryani (especially prawn biryani) gets praise, also other non-vegetarian dishes are regarded well. People often say non-veg items are better than some of the veg offerings. Since rooftop restaurants often emphasise barbecue or tandoor cooking (smoking, grilling, richer flavours), items like kebabs, tandoori stuff likely feature among what they do well. Some reviews mention interesting welcome drinks or creative non-alcoholic beverages that people appreciated, especially those which balance sweetness, freshness (fruits), etc.
